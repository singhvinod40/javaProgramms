Suppose we have to create a phone object
    and it has 5,6 data members
    now we need to provide either all field to constructor or do lots of constructor overloading with null

    Also the sequence  of constructor param  matter.


 sol -:    So we will create setters and every setters will return the phone object
            sequence is not object



            //////Use this when you have multiple parameter to constructor
